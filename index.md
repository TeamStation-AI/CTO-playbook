# CTO Playbook — Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™

A practical field guide for CTOs and VPEs who want **predictable delivery** (without vendor noise) using a governed platform:
- **Axiom Cortex™ (Unified Cognitive AI Evaluation Engine)** — multi-step semantic analysis (RAG), staged prompting, and **L2-aware** fairness calibration. Expert review validates high-impact flags before roll-up.  
- **Nebula Neural Search™** — role/stack/level matching across LATAM tuned to **rate bands**, **time zones**, and historical delivery signals.  
- **SSOT governance** — one auditable box for **hiring → onboarding → devices/MDM → EOR → performance** under a single SLA.

---

## Executive summary (what changes for the CTO)

- **Evidence over anecdotes**: evaluations, shortlists, and performance are traceable to artifacts you can show to leadership and audit.  
- **Single accountable SLA**: no stitching together staffing + devices + payroll + performance. The Co-Pilot™ runs end-to-end.  
- **Faster cycles with guardrails**: calibrated shortlists, Day-1 readiness, and behavior-anchored reviews (BARS) to keep teams moving without quality drift.

**Operating baselines you can plan around**  
- **Time-to-Offer (TTO)** ≈ **9 days**  
- **Time-to-First-PR** ≤ **7–14 days**  
- **MTPD** (mean time to provision device) **≤ 5 days**  
- **MDM enrollment** **≥ 99% in 24h**  
- **90-day retention** ≈ **96%**

## Why this works (in plain English)

**Axiom Cortex™:** aligns candidates to **your outcomes**, not résumés. It maps role expectations to observable behaviors (BARS baselines), separates the **thinking signal** from language-form noise (L2-aware math), and produces an **auditable evidence trail**—strengths, gaps, risk signals, and mindset fit.

**Nebula Neural Search™:** finds and ranks LATAM talent by role/stack/level with calibration to your rate bands and time zone, weighting **real evidence** from Axiom Cortex™ and prior delivery signals.

**SSOT governance:** a controlled, versioned workspace for everything from evaluation artifacts to device posture and quarterly reviews, so you can export **board-ready** proof without hunting through emails and spreadsheets.
