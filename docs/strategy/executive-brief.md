# Executive Brief

**Goal:** expand US-timezone engineering with control, accountability, and measurable ROI.

**Why now:** demand volatility + budget pressure ended the “body-shop” era. The Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™ provides a **governed, end-to-end platform**—hiring to performance—under one SLA.

**What changes for the CTO**
- One **SSOT** for evaluations, offers, onboarding readiness, devices, and performance.
- **Axiom Cortex™** produces auditable, bias-mitigated evaluations; **Nebula** delivers calibrated shortlists.
- **BARS** (behavior-anchored ratings) keep feedback objective; promotion signals are explicit.
