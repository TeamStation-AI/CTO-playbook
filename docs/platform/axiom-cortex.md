# Axiom Cortex™ — Unified Cognitive AI Evaluation Engine

**Purpose:** align candidates to **your outcomes**, not résumés.

- Role → problem statements → observable behaviors (BARS baseline)
- Surfaces strengths, gaps, risk flags, mindset-fit to goals
- Produces shareable evidence: reasoning artifacts, rubrics, summaries

**How (plain English):** semantic chunking in RAG + staged/multi-step prompting; **L2-aware validation** separates thinking signal from language-form noise; expert reviewers confirm high-impact flags before synthesis.
