# CTO FAQ

Below are concise, operator-grade answers to the questions we hear most from CTOs and VPs of Engineering.

## Platform & Fit

<details>
<summary>What is TeamStation AI in one sentence?</summary>
<br>
A governed **Nearshore IT Co-Pilot™** that runs the end-to-end lifecycle—**hiring → onboarding → devices/MDM → EOR/payroll → performance**—under **one accountable SLA**, with **Axiom Cortex™** (cognitive evaluation) and **Nebula Neural Search™** (role-fit matching).
</details>

<details>
<summary>How is this different from a staffing agency?</summary>
<br>
**Operating model**, not headcount brokerage. You get:
- **SSOT** (single source of truth) for artifacts and audits
- **Axiom Cortex™** evaluations with fairness controls and evidence
- **Nebula** shortlists calibrated to role/stack/level
- **Built-in Day-1 readiness** (devices, access, first ticket)
- **BARS** (behavior-anchored ratings) and KPIs for ongoing performance
</details>

<details>
<summary>Who is the ideal customer?</summary>
<br>
Engineering orgs that need predictable delivery in US time zones, want **auditable evaluations**, and prefer a single SLA instead of juggling multiple vendors for staffing, devices, payroll, and performance.
</details>

## Axiom Cortex™ (Evaluation Science)

<details>
<summary>What exactly does Axiom Cortex™ do?</summary>
<br>
It aligns candidates to **your outcomes** (not just keywords) by mapping role expectations to **observable behaviors** and synthesizing a cognitive profile:
- **Semantic chunking in RAG** + staged/multi-step NLP-based-prompting (Processing 44 Neuro-Psychometric algorithms and formulas)
- **L2-aware validation** (separates thinking signal from language-form noise)
- **Expert review** of high-impact flags before roll-up
Outputs: strengths, gaps, risk flags, mindset fit, and shareable evidence.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you prevent model hallucination?</summary>
<br>
A “**zero-tolerance for hallucination**” rule: every conclusion must be traceable to interview evidence. The system executes in **phases** (micro-analysis → synthesis → validation); if a validation gate fails, the report doesn’t publish.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What are the latent traits you measure?</summary>
<br>
- **Architectural Instinct** (top-down reasoning & trade-offs)
- **Problem-Solving Agility** (adaptation under changing constraints)
- **Learning Orientation** (calibrated confidence & authenticity)
- **Collaborative Mindset** (team framing & stakeholder awareness)
</details>

<details>
<summary>How is fairness handled for non-native English speakers (L2)?</summary>
<br>
L2-aware math: **proficiency-normalized scoring**, **cross-lingual semantic fidelity** (no “translation penalty”), code-switch awareness, and **DIF** checks to ensure rubrics don’t behave differently for L2 vs L1 at the same skill.
</details>

## Matching (Nebula Neural Search™)

<details>
<summary>How do you build shortlists?</summary>
<br>
Neural search tuned to your **role/stack/level**, weighted by **Axiom Cortex™** evidence and historical delivery signals, calibrated to **rate bands** and **time zone**. The output is a shortlist you can take straight into interviews.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What coverage do you have in LATAM?</summary>
<br>
Broad coverage across major hubs and remote locales in US-overlapping time zones; we calibrate to your working hours and language requirements.
</details>

## Security, Devices & Compliance

<details>
<summary>What device and MDM posture do you target?</summary>
<br>
- **MDM enrollment ≥ 99% within 24h**
- **MTPD** (mean time to provision device) **≤ 5 days**
- Day-1 readiness: device, baseline apps, identity/access, first ticket
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you handle privacy and compliance?</summary>
<br>
GDPR/CCPA-aligned practices, SSOT access control, auditable trails, and in-country **EOR/payroll** compliance. We source from public/consented data and enforce retention policies.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What about IP protection?</summary>
<br>
SSOT permissions, least-privilege access, contract IP assignment, device control/remote wipe, and audit logs. We align to your DPA/IAA requirements.
</details>

---

## Performance & Governance

<details>
<summary>How do you manage performance objectively?</summary>
<br>
**BARS** (behavior-anchored ratings) with role-specific anchors (ticket ownership, review quality, reliability). KPIs include time-to-first-PR, cycle time, review throughput, and defect escape rate. Promotion signals are explicit (L1–L4).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does a typical timeline look like?</summary>
<br>
**Time-to-Offer ≈ 9 days**, **First-PR ≤ 7–14 days**, device **MTPD ≤ 5 days**, **MDM ≥ 99% in 24h**, ~**96%** 90-day retention.
</details>

---

## Integrations & Data

<details>
<summary>Can you integrate with our ATS/HRIS?</summary>
<br>
Yes—intake, status sync, and artifact linking through lightweight connectors or API/webhooks. We keep the **SSOT** canonical for audits and export to your systems of record.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can we export everything if we leave?</summary>
<br>
Yes. All SSOT artifacts, evaluation records, and performance data are **portable**. We maintain an exit playbook to prevent lock-in.
</details>

## Cost & ROI

<details>
<summary>How is pricing structured?</summary>
<br>
Transparent platform pricing aligned to role/level and in-country EOR scope. See the ROI and pricing estimator:
- Pricing ranges: [https://teamstation.dev/nearshore-it-staff-augmentation-pricing](https://teamstation.dev/nearshore-it-staff-augmentation-pricing)
- Estimator app: [https://pricing.teamstation.dev/](https://pricing.teamstation.dev/)
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you prove ROI?</summary>
<br>
We report against the core metrics: **TTO, First-PR, MTPD, MDM enrollment, retention**, plus delivery KPIs. SSOT exports provide board/LP-grade evidence.
</details>

## SLAs, Risk & Continuity

<details>
<summary>What SLAs matter most?</summary>
<br>
- **Evaluation & shortlist cadence** (days to shortlist)
- **Day-1 readiness** (ARR, device/MDM posture)
- **Operational KPIs** (cycle time, review throughput)
- **Security posture** (MDM ≥ 99% in 24h; MTPD ≤ 5 days)
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if a hire isn’t a fit?</summary>
<br>
We manage replacement under the same SLA, using Axiom Cortex™ evidence + BARS data to correct the fit quickly and transparently.
</details>

## Getting Started

<details>
<summary>What do you need from us to start?</summary>
<br>
A 45-minute intake: role/stack/level, rate band, rubrics, security must-haves, and working hours. We calibrate the shortlist target and start the Axiom Cortex™ pipeline.
